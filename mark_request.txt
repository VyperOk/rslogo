## Design Excellence

If you have completed a "design excellence" task, please write what
the task was below (note, it MUST be on the list in the assignment or
approved by COMP6991 staff).

> The design excellence task that I have completed is getting 80% test coverage.

Please write a paragraph or two (max. 250 words) describing how your design was
influenced by this challenge, with specific reference to sections of your code.
If you completed the "Pull Request" design excellence, please just leave a link
to your PR.

>  I used tarpaulin to do this. The way I did this is, I used the sample 
implementation to generate the correct output as an svg, I then computed my 
solution and asserted that these two files are equal. The way I implemented 
errors was that the program would exit right away, to adapt to this in testing 
I changed the function to panic iff the current instance is a test. This way 
the program functions as normal and if it is a test then it will panic. I 
mostly used the examples that were given, I also tested the error cases as 
when I tested all cases if the program panic it would stop all other tests. So,
I made a test suite for all the success cases which just loops through all the
examples and if the expected is an error then it will skip it otherwise it will
compare with the expected solution. I then manually wrote test cases for  the 
example fail cases and then also added a few more cases of my own. My design 
was influenced by this challenge as I had to think about how to adjust my code 
to work for testing, as when I exit the program, it also exits the test, this 
initally gave me some trouble until I thought I could use a seperate test 
function which worked well.

## Design Limitations

If you made any design decisions which you now regret making; but don't to go back and change them,
let us know here. You can make up your design marks by acknowledging up to 5 things you would do
differently now.

> Start with values as expressions from the beginning.
> Maybe return an error instead if exitting the program instantly

## Other Comments

If you want to let us know something else about your program, put it here!

> I am not sure what is submitted to you when I submit, in my rslogo (outside of my src) I have a
logo_examples_out folder and a tests folder which hold my files for testing in it. If you do not 
have them I wrote a shell script to create them from vlab using 6991 rslogo. I have a private git
repo that I can share with you if needed to show that it was completed before the due time if you
dont have access to these folders in submittion. 

> This was a really good assignment, I really enjoyed it, everything just went well like the 
it was easy to progress through and I feel like the previous part helped me for the next.
